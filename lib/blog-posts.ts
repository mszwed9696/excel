Selling your home in Southern New Jersey doesn't have to take months. With the right strategy, you can attract qualified buyers and close quickly while still getting top dollar for your property.

## 1. Price It Right From Day One

The biggest mistake sellers make is overpricing their home. In competitive Southern NJ markets like Marlton, Moorestown, and Glassboro, overpriced homes sit on the market while well-priced properties sell within weeks.

**Strategy:** Work with a local agent who knows recent sales in your specific town. In Gloucester County, pricing should reflect neighborhood comparables, school district ratings, and current market conditions.

## 2. Professional Photos Are Non-Negotiable

Your listing photos are the first impression buyers get. Homes with professional photography sell 32% faster than those with amateur photos.

**What works in Southern NJ:** Highlight outdoor spaces (yards are a big selling point here), updated kitchens, and any recent renovations. Capture curb appeal - many Southern NJ homes have charming front porches and mature landscaping that should be showcased.

## 3. Strategic Listing Timing

Timing matters in the Southern New Jersey market. Spring and early fall are peak seasons, but there are advantages to every season:

- **Spring (March-May):** Maximum buyer activity, especially from families wanting to move before the school year
- **Summer:** Slower but serious buyers only
- **Fall (September-October):** Second wave of activity as families settle after summer
- **Winter:** Less competition from other sellers

## 4. Focus on Curb Appeal

First impressions count. Before your first showing:
- Fresh mulch in flower beds
- Power wash siding and walkways
- Paint or stain the front door
- Ensure lawn is well-maintained
- Add seasonal flowers or plants

In towns like Pitman and Mullica Hill where historic charm matters, emphasizing your home's character can be a major selling point.

## 5. Stage Your Home

Staged homes sell faster and for more money. Even small touches make a difference:
- Declutter every room
- Deep clean thoroughly
- Remove personal items and photos
- Create inviting spaces with neutral decor
- Ensure rooms have clear purposes

## 6. Be Flexible with Showings

The more accessible your home is for showings, the faster it will sell. Accommodate evening and weekend showings when possible - that's when most buyers are looking.

## 7. Make Strategic Repairs

You don't need to renovate, but address obvious issues:
- Fix leaky faucets
- Repair cracked tiles
- Patch holes in walls
- Replace burnt-out light bulbs
- Fix sticking doors and windows

Home inspections will reveal these issues anyway. Addressing them upfront shows your home is well-maintained.

## 8. Market Aggressively

Your agent should:
- List on MLS with detailed descriptions
- Post on Zillow, Realtor.com, and other major sites
- Use targeted Facebook and Instagram ads
- Send to their network of buyers and agents
- Host open houses

## 9. Highlight Location Benefits

Southern New Jersey offers incredible location advantages. Emphasize:
- Proximity to Philadelphia (30-45 minutes from many areas)
- Access to excellent schools
- Near major employers (Rowan University, Cooper Health, etc.)
- Community amenities and recreation
- Low property taxes compared to North Jersey

## 10. Work with a Local Expert

Generic real estate advice doesn't account for local Southern NJ nuances. A local agent knows:
- Which neighborhoods are hot right now
- What buyers in your town value most
- Recent sale prices of comparable homes
- Buyer preferences specific to your area

Finding the right off-campus housing at Rowan University can make or break your college experience. With over 19,600 students and limited on-campus housing, the off-campus market is competitive. This guide gives you everything you need to find the perfect place.

## When to Start Your Search

**November-January: BEST TIME**
This is peak listing season for the following academic year. You'll have maximum selection and best pricing. Popular houses in downtown Glassboro go fast during this period.

**February-April: STILL GOOD**
Solid selection remains. Many quality properties available, but the best locations may be taken.

**May-August: LIMITED**
Fewer options, but you may find last-minute deals from landlords with remaining vacancies.

**Pro Tip:** Start looking in November if you want first pick of houses walking distance to campus.

## Best Neighborhoods for Rowan Students

### Downtown Glassboro (Most Popular)
**Walk Score: 9/10 | Average Rent: $600-700/room**

The heart of student life. Streets like High Street, Main Street, Academy Street, and Victoria Street are packed with student houses.

**Pros:**
- 5-15 minute walk to campus
- Walk to restaurants, Landmark (bars), Royal Bean (coffee)
- Active social scene
- Don't need a car

**Cons:**
- Can be noisy on weekends
- Limited parking
- Older houses (some need updates)
- Higher rent than suburbs

**Best For:** Undergrads who want the classic off-campus experience. Freshmen and sophomores moving off-campus for the first time.

### Pitman (Budget-Friendly & Quiet)
**Walk Score: 4/10 | Average Rent: $500-650/room**

Historic town directly adjacent to Glassboro. Charming downtown with unique shops and restaurants.

**Pros:**
- 15-20% cheaper than Glassboro
- Quieter atmosphere for studying
- Beautiful small-town feel
- Good local restaurants and cafes

**Cons:**
- Need a car (10 minute drive to campus)
- Less social scene
- Fewer student housing options
- Not walking distance

**Best For:** Grad students, upperclassmen with cars, students who prioritize quiet and affordability over being in the center of things.

### Mullica Hill / Williamstown (Modern)
**Walk Score: 2/10 | Average Rent: $900-1,200/bedroom**

Newer suburban areas 15-20 minutes from campus. Modern apartment complexes with amenities.

**Pros:**
- Brand new construction
- Modern amenities (pools, gyms, dog parks)
- More space and privacy
- Plenty of parking

**Cons:**
- 15-20 minute drive to campus
- Car absolutely required
- Higher rent for newer units
- Isolated from student social scene
- Less "college town" vibe

**Best For:** Upperclassmen and grad students who prioritize modern amenities and quiet. Good for commuter students or those with mostly online classes.

## Budget Breakdown

### Shared House (per person)
- Rent: $500-700/room
- Utilities (split): $50-100
- Internet (split): $15-25
- Groceries: $200-300
- Transportation: $50-100
- **Total: $815-1,225/month**

### 1-Bedroom Apartment
- Rent: $900-1,200

- Utility Deposits: $100-200
- Furniture/Supplies: $300-800
- **Total Move-In: ~$1,500-3,000**

## Money-Saving Tips

1. **More roommates = lower cost per person.** A 6-person house costs significantly less per room than a 3-person apartment.

2. **Sign early.** Landlords reward early commitments with better rates. Houses listed in November often offer $50-100/month discounts vs. listings in April.

3. **Consider Pitman.** Save 15-20% on rent vs. downtown Glassboro if you have a car.

4. **Share grocery trips.** Cook together with roommates to cut food costs in half.

5. **Walk/bike when possible.** Living downtown eliminates transportation costs entirely.

## Application Process

### What You'll Need
- Valid photo ID
- Rowan student ID
- Social Security Number
- Parent/cosigner information
- Proof of income (usually parent's)

Most landlords require parent cosigners since students typically lack credit history or income.

### Background Checks
Expect credit checks, background checks, and rental history verification. Application fees ($25-75) are standard and non-refundable.

## Lease Timing and Length

Most student leases run 12 months (August to August) aligned with the academic year. Some landlords offer:
- 9-month leases
- Summer sublet options
- Early move-in for summer sessions

**Read your lease carefully** for:
- Pet policies
- Guest policies
- Subletting rules
- Maintenance responsibilities
- Early termination clauses

## Red Flags to Watch For

🚩 Landlord won't let you see property before signing
🚩 No written lease agreement
🚩 Requests cash only payments
🚩 Pressures you to sign immediately
🚩 Property has obvious safety issues
🚩 Poor communication or difficult to reach

## Making the Most of Off-Campus Living

### Roommate Success
- Set ground rules early (cleaning schedules, quiet hours, guests)
- Use apps like Splitwise to track shared expenses
- Communicate issues promptly before they become big problems
- Respect each other's privacy and space

### Being a Good Tenant
- Pay rent on time (set up auto-pay)
- Report maintenance issues quickly
- Keep the property reasonably clean
- Be respectful of neighbors
- Document everything with photos at move-in

### Safety First
- Keep doors and windows locked
- Install a fire extinguisher
- Check smoke and CO detectors monthly
- Don't leave valuables visible from windows
- Get renters insurance ($10-20/month)

## Final Advice

**For First-Time Off-Campus Students:**
Start your search in November or December. Visit properties in person if possible. Don't sign anything without reading it thoroughly (have parents review too). Choose roommates carefully - you'll be living together for a year.

**For Parents:**
Visit properties with your student if you can. Review the lease carefully before cosigning - you're legally responsible if your student doesn't pay. Verify smoke detectors, locks, and overall safety. Consider renters insurance.

**For International Students:**
Start earlier (October if possible) as visa paperwork may complicate applications. Connect with Rowan's International Student Services for housing assistance. Consider furnished options to avoid furniture costs.
